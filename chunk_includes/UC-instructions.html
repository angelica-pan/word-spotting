<p> You will be listening to sentences while looking at a cross (+) at the center of the screen. Please listen to each sentence carefully so that you understand it fully. </p>
<p> Before each sentence, you will be given a word to monitor for. While listening to the sentence, press the SPACEBAR as soon as you hear the word. The given word might not actually be in the sentence, and each sentence will play only one time, so listen carefully! </p>
<p> Some of the sentences will be followed by comprehension questions. Press the F or J key to select the answer on the left or the answer on the right, respectively. </p>
