<center> <h2> Welcome! </h2> </center>
<p> You will be listening to sentences while looking at a cross (+) at the center of the screen. Please listen to each sentence carefully so that you understand it fully. </p>
<p> Before each sentence, you will be given a word to monitor for. While listening to the sentence, press the spacebar as soon as you hear the word. The given word might not actually be in the sentence, and each sentence will play only one time, so pay close attention! </p>
<p> <b>This study will be measuring speed and accuracy</b>: if the target word is in the sentence, it is important to press the spacebar as quickly as possible. If the target word is not in the sentence, it is important to not press the spacebar.</p>
<p> Some of the sentences will be followed by comprehension questions. Press the F or J key to select the answer on the left or the answer on the right, respectively. </p>
